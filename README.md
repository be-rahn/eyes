# eyes

## Project Description
Moving eyes exercise for MITxPRO coding bootcamp using mostly HTML and CSS. Eyes follow the movement of the mouse.

## How to Run
View the app on my homepage at https://be-rahn.github.io/ and click the Launch eyes button. You can also run this project by cloning the repository to your local machine and opening the index.html file in your browser.

## Future Improvements
I would like to improve this application by using the techniques learned to create more eyes and effects when the mouse hovers over the page.
